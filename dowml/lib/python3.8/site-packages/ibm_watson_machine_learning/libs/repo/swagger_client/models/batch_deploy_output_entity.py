    IBM Watson Machine Learning REST API

    ## Authorization  ### IBM Watson Machine Learning Credentials  To start working with API one needs to generate an `access token` using the `username` and `password` available on the Service Credentials tab of the IBM Watson Machine Learning service instance or also available in the VCAP environment variable.  Example of the Service Credentials:  ```json {     \"url\": \"https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net\",     \"access_key\": \"ERY9vcBfE4sE+F4g8hcotF9L+j81WXWeZv\",     \"username\": \"c1ef4b80-2ee2-458e-ab92-e9ca97ec657d\",     \"password\": \"030528d4-5a3e-4d4c-9258-5d553513be6f\" } ```  Example of obtaining `access token` from Token Endpoint using HTTP Basic Auth (for details please refer to Token section below):  ` curl --basic --user username:password https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net/v3/identity/token `   ### Apache Spark Service Credentials  The IBM Watson Machine Learning co-operates with the Apache Spark as a Service to deploy pipeline models. For API methods requiring Apache Spark Service instance a custom header: `X-Spark-Service-Instance` with Service Credentials must be specified. The header value is a **base64 encoded** string with the Service Credentials JSON data.  [Example of API method requiring Apache Spark Service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/PredictiveModeling/index-gentopic1.html#pm_service_api_spark_batch)
