V1.8.0:

- [#57] 'cancel' accepts job specifications such as * and n-m
- [#55] We can't delete the Watson Studio job when connected to a CPD
        instance. But at least we can stop warning about that...
- [#53] Store the details first when dumping a job, in case there's
        an error later in the process

        the environment


V1.6.0:

- [#47] Add a 'api-key' parameter to the Interactive
- [#40] Introduce cancel_job function. Deprecate hard parameter in call
        to delete_job, which now really deletes the job by default.

- [#44] Speed-up job creation by caching deployment information
- [#43] Add 'status' command in the Interactive

V1.4.1:

- [#41] Prevent crash when using '--region' and credentials didn't include
        a URL.
- [#39] When creating the space, wait for it to be fully ready instead of
        (trying to) use it immediately.


V1.4.0:

- [#37] Allow to override the URL in the credentials with a command-line
        argument (in the Interactive) or a constructor argument (in the
        library). Also, allows to specify a region instead of a URL (for
        the known regions).
- [#36] Don't leave the Watson Studio runs dangling when deleting a job.


V1.3.1:

- Update the documentation in README.md
- Update the sample session in README.md


V1.3.0:

- [#34] 'dump' downloads and stores all the inputs and outputs of a job,
        so that all the data is readily available. Replaces 'output', which
        is now deprecated.
- [#33] Print status of job while waiting for completion.


V1.2.0:

- [#32] 'output' downloads the output data assets, not just inline outputs.
- [#31] The 'log' command wouldn't work if the job used 'outputs assets'.
        Fix that.

        not interrupted.


V1.1.0:

- [#3]  Accept 'delete 2-5' to delete a range of jobs.

        outputs from inline to data-assets.
- [#21] Read credentials from file $DOWML_CREDENTIALS_FILE
        as last resort.
